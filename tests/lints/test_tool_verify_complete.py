"""Gate: every registered tool is accounted for in the live tool verification.

The live run (tests/live/tool_verify.py) needs a running Fusion, so it can't run in this
mock suite - but its COMPLETENESS can be checked here from the registry alone: every registered
tool must be covered by a STEP, excused in EXCLUDED, or listed in PENDING. A newly added tool that
is none of these fails here, so coverage can't silently decay as the tool surface grows. The three
tables are shrink-only in spirit (scripting a tool moves it PENDING -> STEPS); stale entries (a
name in a table that no longer registers) also fail, so the tables can't rot the other way.
