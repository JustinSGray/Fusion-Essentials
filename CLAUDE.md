# Working in Fusion-Essentials (MCP server)

The rules every tool under `commands/mcpServer/` follows, whichever file it lives in.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains the architecture and the ideas behind it.
[commands/mcpServer/tools/CLAUDE.md](commands/mcpServer/tools/CLAUDE.md) is the recipe for adding a
tool (the helper catalog, exemplars, the lints) and loads automatically when you work in that
directory. [tests/CLAUDE.md](tests/CLAUDE.md) covers writing a test. The code is the source of truth;
when in doubt, match the nearest existing tool.

## Planning files

Keep `plans` sparse; it is private and absent from a clone. `plans/backlog.md` is the ledger, the one
list of open work. A handoff that is ready for native testing or acceptance goes in
`plans/<BACKLOG-ROW-ID>.md`. Update an existing row instead of writing a competing plan or status
report, and delete a row's plan when the row is removed.
Put agent scratch files, reports, evidence, exports and worker handoffs in the gitignored `outputs/` directory. Keep `tests/live/evals/results/` for real eval runs and `.cache` for tooling caches and isolated worktrees. Remove temporary scaffolding when a task finishes.

## Read vs Edit: the two kinds

A tool either changes state or it does not, and its `write=` flag records which. This is
Command-Query Separation, and it is the one split a machine can check.

| Kind | Does | `write=` | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Read** | Return information, change nothing. Safe to call at any time. | read | `cam_get`, `find_geometry`, `model_measure_between`, `workspace_orient` |
| **Edit** | Act: change the model or data, or run an async operation. Gets the write guard; must verify its effect. | write / destructive | `model_extrude`, `joint_edit`, `doc_save`, `cam_edit_tools` |

A Read comes in three shapes. They help you choose the tool's form; the permission is the same.
- **Orient** (`orient`) - one cheap read across every area to get your bearings: where am I, what is
  broken, where next. Call it first; it returns a summary, not everything. `workspace_orient`.
- **Disclose** (`get`) - a rich read of one area: a small default, and more through `include=` or a
  scope. `cam_get`, `design_get`, `doc_get`, `data_get`.
- **Acquire** (`find`/`measure`/`probe`/`inspect`/`compare`/`screenshot`/`section`/`compute`/`request`) -
  a read whose output feeds an Edit: a handle, a measurement, an image, a user pick, a diff. For
  example, `find_geometry` returns a handle and `joint_at_geometry` consumes it (see `_inputs.py`). An
  Acquire has its own query parameters and returns handles, so **it stays a separate tool from a
  Disclose read**.

## Naming schema

Every tool is `<domain>_<verb>[_<noun>]`, with `<verb>` from a closed vocabulary, and **the verb's kind
must agree with `write=`**: a read verb (`get`/`find`/`probe`/...) is read-only and an edit verb
changes state. So `cam_get` reads, `model_compute_holder` acquires and `cam_edit_tools` writes.
`test_tool_naming.py` enforces this and holds the verb vocabulary. The exemptions (a poller like
`cam_get_status`; a read-verb tool that still changes state, such as `view_section`) and how Edit tools
are packaged (`action=` dispatch, one verb per file) are in
[commands/mcpServer/tools/CLAUDE.md](commands/mcpServer/tools/CLAUDE.md).

## Honesty contract (the rule that matters most)

- Use `ok(...)` / `error(...)` from `_common`. Wrap per-field reads in `safe(getter, default)` so one
  bad field does not sink the call, but let a mutation raise. A failed delete or edit must return
  `isError`, never `ok`.
- After a write, verify the effect and report it. If the API returns success but nothing changed
  (it happens), treat that as a failure. Report partial success explicitly: what was done and what
  was not.
- Reading `adsk.*` code cannot tell you what the API actually does. Before "fixing" a geometry,
  matrix or API bug you spotted by reading, reproduce it live first (`sys_execute_script` against a
  scratch document, or drive the tool and read the result back), and confirm the fix live too. A
  plausible-looking bug is often correct code whose API contract you misread, and the "fix" is the
  regression.
- Guard inputs and say *why* a precondition failed, naming the offending value. Resolve references
  (occurrences, geometry) through the typed kinds described under "Input kinds" below.
- Resolving a name yourself: whether taking the first match is a bug depends on whether the name is
  unique. A **scope-unique** name (a CAM setup or operation) resolves correctly by case-insensitive
  exact match, returning the available names on a miss (`_cam_common.find_operation`). A
  **non-unique** name (two sub-assemblies each holding a "Bolt:1") must **refuse** the ambiguity,
  never return the first substring/`.find()`/`[0]` hit, which silently targets the wrong entity.
  `test_no_first_match_resolvers` catches the shapes that are always wrong (substring, first by
  index), but deciding whether a name is unique is your call.

## Input kinds

To reference existing geometry or structure (face, edge, body, plane, axis, profile, occurrence,
length, fixed choice), use a typed kind from [`_inputs.py`](commands/mcpServer/tools/_inputs.py)
instead of hand-rolling a `name` or `index` resolver. The kinds refuse ambiguity instead of grabbing
the wrong instance. Wire one with `tool.add_input_property(*kind.as_property())` and resolve it with
`_inputs.resolve_inputs(...)`. If a kind is close but lacks a selector, extend the kind, not one
tool's local copy. The full catalog of kinds and shared helpers is the generated map in
[commands/mcpServer/tools/CLAUDE.md](commands/mcpServer/tools/CLAUDE.md), which loads when you author
a tool.

## Tool descriptions and agent-facing strings

A tool's **description** and the `note`/`error` it returns are the only things a connected agent
knows about it. They cross the wire JSON-serialized with `ensure_ascii`, so keep them pure ASCII
(` - ` not `—`, `...` not `…`, `->` not `→`, `deg` not `°`); `test_wire_ascii.py` enforces this. Every
claim about an input's legal values must be backed by something that fails when the claim is false (a
`Choice`/enum, a typed kind's `resolve()`, a guard). If you can't back it, type the input instead of
asserting it.

Every call pays for these strings, so they are budgeted (`test_prose_budget.py`): a description says
what the tool does and what to call next; a note says what was observed and the next step; an error
names the offending value and the remedy. None of them says that something was measured, why the
platform behaves that way, or how the code is built. That teaching goes in the error an agent meets
at the moment it matters, once. A rich read's deep `include=` returns the slice asked for, not the
default slice again.

## What "done" means

A change is done when its row in the live sweep (`tests/live/tool_verify.py`) passes on the real Fusion
session and its receipt (`tests/live/VERIFIED_TOOLS.md`) is restamped. Fixes and features may be
committed only after an independent review, a live run of the affected capabilities on the exact code
loaded in Fusion, matching receipts and passing required checks. A checkpoint verified only offline
does not qualify; keep unfinished work in isolated worktrees and gitignored backups.
Each changed behavior an agent can observe needs a reproducible demonstration in the existing live
sweep, with an independent check of its effect in the same change. Internal helpers are exercised
through the public behavior they affect; naming a tool in the sweep does not by itself validate new
logic.
Mock unit tests prove handler logic and nothing about Fusion: they encode the builder's beliefs, and a
wrong belief pinned by a test is the most confident way to ship a lie. So: one test per plausible bug,
not one per function; a reviewer runs a handful of mutants, not dozens; and the reviewer drives the
live session to check API claims whenever it can. The three defects found on 2026-09-02 (a false `ok`
pinned by a test, a classifier whose docstring asserted the opposite of the live shape, a remedy the
agent could not act on) all came from thirty minutes of using the tools, none from 11,000 unit tests.
Every wave (one batch of backlog work) ends with a cold eval run (`tests/live/evals/proctor.py`: a
fresh agent with no skill appended), so only what the tools say on the wire is graded.

## Enforcement is a closed list

The files in `tests/lints/` are the closed list: the wire contract (naming + verb/`write=`
agreement, write-status, strict schema, input names, output contracts, ASCII, wire budget and shape, prose
budget), the honesty contract (no fabricated fallbacks, bool returns checked, no first-match resolvers,
postconditions declared, units, native identity keys, export knob pre-read, frame disclosure, material
effect, rename adoption, no hand-cast product), and the structure (helper duplication denylist, no
duplicate defs, dead code, autodiscovery, unit-coverage-complete, tool-verify-complete, generated docs
current, doc citations, measured enums, fake shapes, evergreen). Adding a lint file needs the owner's
word; a new duplication class gets a denylist entry, not a file. No ratchets, no per-file
baselines, no self-tests for lints, no lint that polices wording. The suite
regrew twice after purges because every review finding became a lint. A finding becomes a backlog
row, a fix, and a step in the live sweep.

## Prose in code

A docstring is one line saying what the function returns or does; a comment is at most three lines
stating a present-tense fact the code cannot show (a platform trap at its point of use, with no history).
A helper's catalog blurb is one line: its symbols and when to reach for it. Everything longer is cut, and
`test_prose_budget.py` says where.

## Running commands: never `cd` to the repo root, never redirect stderr

Both shell tools already start in the repo root and already capture stderr, so `cd c:\Source\Fusion-Essentials`
and `2>&1` are redundant. Together they are worse: a `cd` combined with an output redirect makes the
permission layer ask the owner to approve the call by hand, **whatever the allow rules say**, because
it cannot tell where the redirect target resolves after the `cd`. That habit causes more approval
prompts than anything else in this repo, and every prompt interrupts a person.

So: `py -3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_sketch_add_geometry.py -q`, not
`cd c:\Source\Fusion-Essentials; py -3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_sketch_add_geometry.py -q 2>&1 | Select-String "passed|failed"`.
To trim output, use `-q`/`--no-cov` and read the tail rather than filtering with a regex; a pipe is
fine, the `cd` and the `2>&1` are not. Prefer the file tools (Read/Grep/Edit/Write) over shell
equivalents for anything that touches files.
